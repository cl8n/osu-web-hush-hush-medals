# osu!web "Hush-Hush" medal unlocks

This is a proof of concept structure for awarding "Hush-Hush" (i.e. secret) medals from the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) website. The real repo should not be public, obviously.

## Usage

Clone this into `hush-hush-medals/` at the top level of osu-web and use [my "medal-examples" branch](https://github.com/cl8n/osu-web/tree/medal-examples).
